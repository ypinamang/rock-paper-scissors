# rock-paper-scissors
Good old rock paper scissors in JavaScript. Below is the pseudocode to demonstrate my thought process for the app.

Note: The app does not use an array for the choices, so for the machine choice, I generate a random number between 1 and 3, and assign rock, paper, or scissors depending on the number generated.

## Pseudocode 

## Generate and convert machine choice
CREATE a function that returns rock, paper, or scissors based on random number


## Get user choice and machine choice
CREATE a variable that stores the user's choice
CREATE a variable that stores the machine's choice
