# rock-paper-scissors
Good old rock paper scissors in JavaScript. Below is the pseudocode to demonstrate my thought process for the app.

Note: The app does not use an array for the choices, so for the machine choice, I generate a random number between 1 and 3, and assign rock, paper, or scissors depending on the number generated.

## Pseudocode 

## Generate and convert machine choice
CREATE a function that returns rock, paper, or scissors based on random number

GENERATE random number between 1 and 3
IF random number is 1
    RETURN "Rock"
ELSE IF random number is 2
    RETURN "Paper"
ELSE
    RETURN "Scissors"


## Get user choice and machine choice
CREATE a variable to store the user's choice
CREATE a variable to store the machine's choice
CALL the function that returns the machine's choice
ASSIGN the machine's choice to the machine choice variable
ASK the user for a choice between Rock, Paper, and Scissors
ASSIGN the user's choice to the user choice variable


## Create a function to compare
